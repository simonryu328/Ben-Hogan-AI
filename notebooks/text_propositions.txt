The statement 'Good golf begins with a good grip' emphasizes the importance of the grip in golf.
The battery in baseball is composed of a pitcher and a catcher.
The grip is often seen as the drabbest part of the swing by most golfers.
Most golfers perceive the grip as accomplishing nothing active or decisive.
Walter Hagen had a beautiful grip on the golf club, delicate yet powerful.
Jack Burke also has a very impressive way of placing his hands on the club.
A professional golfer's admiration for an impressive grip stems from knowing that the grip is essential for the action of the golf swing.
The grip is the player's only contact point with the ball through the clubhead.
The power in the golf swing is generated by the body and transferred through the arms to the hands and then to the clubhead.
The power multiplies itself with each transfer, similar to a chain action in physics.
A proper grip is crucial for the chain action in the golf swing to work effectively.
A golfer with a defective grip will struggle to control the club at the top of the backswing.
If the club is not controlled by a proper grip, the power generated by the body will not reach the club through the hands on the downswing.
The clubhead cannot achieve its maximum acceleration without a proper grip to control it.
A golfer’s power is originated and generated by the movements of the body.
The power is transferred from the player’s body to his arms.
The power is then transferred from the player’s arms to his hands.
The power multiplies itself enormously with every transfer.
The multiplication of power is like a chain action in physics.
The standard grip is the overlapping grip.
Harry Vardon popularized the overlapping grip in Great Britain and America over half a century ago.
No grip found so far promotes as effective a union between the body and the club.
We have to stick with the overlapping grip until a better one comes along.
In a good grip, both hands act as ONE UNIT.
Gripping the club almost correctly means gripping it partially incorrectly.
A right-handed player kills any chance for a cooperative union of both hands if his right hand is dominant.
To ensure a firm two-handed grip, get your left hand on the club absolutely correctly.
To place the club in the left hand correctly, press the shaft up under the muscular pad at the inside heel of the palm, and lie the shaft directly across the top joint of the forefinger.
The drawing accompanying the instructions will clarify the correct hand placement.
Crook the forefinger around the shaft to lift the club and maintain a fairly firm grip on it.
Just use the muscles of the finger and the muscles of the pad of the palm.
The muscles of the finger and the muscles of the pad of the palm are involved.
Just close the left hand. Close the fingers before you close the thumb.
The club will be just where it should be when you close the left hand.
There are two views of the completed left-hand grip.
The main pressure points of the completed left-hand grip are the last three fingers.
TO GAIN A REAL ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS PREPARATORY GUIDE TO CORRECT GRIPPING, I WOULD SUGGEST PRACTICING IT FIVE OR 10 MINUTES A DAY FOR A WEEK UNTIL IT BEGINS TO BECOME SECOND NATURE.
When a golfer has completed his left-hand grip, the V formed by the thumb and forefinger should point to his right eye.
The total pressure of all the fingers should not be any stronger than the pressure exerted by just the forefinger and the palm pad in the preparatory guiding action.
The total pressure of all the fingers may even be a little less strong than the pressure exerted by just the forefinger and the palm pad in the preparatory guiding action.
In the completed grip, the main pressure points are the last three fingers, with the forefinger and the palm pad adding assisting pressure.
The three fingers press up, the pad presses down, and the shaft is locked in between.
Keeping pressure on the shaft with the palm pad strengthens the left arm throughout the swing.
At the top of the backswing, the pressure from the palm pad prevents the club from slipping from the player’s grasp.
The pressure from the palm pad acts as a firm reinforcement at impact.
The pressure mentioned should be “active,” the kind of pressure that makes your hand feel alive and ready for action.
Some golfers grab hold of a club so ferociously they look like they’re going to twist the grip right off it.
There’s no need for overdoing the strength of your grip.
There’s a positive harm in overdoing the strength of your grip: you automatically tighten the cords in the left arm and render it so stiff that it will be unable to hear your requests and give you a muscular response when you start your swing.
Too tight a grip will also immobilize your wrist.
A secure, alive, and comfortable grip is what you want, as the weighted clubhead is swung back, your fingers instinctively tighten their grasp on the shaft.
The left-hand grip is at the top of the backswing.
Two anatomical views show the muscular structure of the left hand.
This drawing shows the proper positioning of the right hand in the completed grip.
The grip of the right hand is more complicated because it is the hand that does the overlapping.
Setting up a strong, correct left hand is one half of the job of establishing a one-unit grip.
The other half of establishing a one-unit grip is getting the right hand in a position to perform its share of the work but no more than its equal share.
Subduing the natural tendency of the right forefinger and thumb to take charge is crucial.
If the right forefinger and thumb take charge, they will ruin the grip.
The 'pincer fingers,' the forefinger and thumb, are useful for daily tasks like opening doors and picking up coffee cups.
However, they are not helpful in building a good grip and a good swing.
The muscles of the right forefinger and thumb connect with a powerful set of muscles along the outside of the right arm, elbow, and shoulder.
Working the tips of the thumb and forefinger together and applying pressure activates the muscles of the right arm and shoulder.
These are not the muscles ideal for the golf swing.
Using these muscles leads to golfers who never swing with both hands working together and rely too much on the right arm and shoulder, resulting in an incorrect swing.
To obtain the proper grip with the right hand, hold it somewhat extended, with the palm facing your target.
Hold the right hand somewhat extended with the palm facing the target.
The left hand is already correctly affixed.
Place the club in your right hand so that the shaft lies across the top joint of the four fingers and definitely below the palm.
As the drawing shows, the club lies across the top joint of the fingers of the right hand.
The club lies across the top joint of the fingers of the right hand.
The two middle fingers supply the major part of the pressure.
Right-hand grip is in the fingers, not the palm.
The V of correct left-hand grip should point to the golfer’s right eye.
The right-hand grip is a finger grip.
The two fingers which should apply most of the pressure are the two middle fingers.
The forefinger shouldn’t be allowed to become too forceful.
The little finger slides up and over the forefinger of the left hand.
The little finger locks itself securely in the groove between the left forefinger and the big finger.
The club is held firmly in the fingers of your right hand.
Simply fold your right hand over your left thumb.
When the right hand is folded over, the right thumb should ride down the left side of the shaft slightly.
The club must be in the fingers and not in the palm.
To get a check on the ball with backspin or to cut the ball up with a nice underspin and to do many other things with the ball, the ball must be hit sharp and crisp.
You can achieve hitting the ball sharp and crisp only if the club is in the fingers of the right hand.
A proper right-hand grip will enable the player to transmit the greatest amount of speed to the clubhead.
Controlled speed is what is wanted, and you can get this control only from the fingers, not from the right hand itself.
A word more about the little finger of the right hand.
It has been approved practice for quite some time to let the little finger ride sort of piggyback on top of the left forefinger.
I would really advise you to hook that little finger in the groove between the forefinger and the big finger.
Hooking the little finger in the groove helps to keep the hands from slipping apart.
It gives the speaker the good feeling that their hands are knitted vigorously together.
A word further about the thumb area of the right hand.
To promote a right-hand grip that is strong where it should be strong, the golfer-reader should cultivate the habit of pressing the thumb and the adjoining part of the hand tightly against each other.
The thumb and the adjoining part of the hand should press up against each other tightly, as inseparable as Siamese twins.
The golfer-reader should maintain airtight pressure between the thumb and the adjoining part of the hand when folding the right hand over the left thumb.
The knuckle on the back of the right hand above the forefinger should press to the left, toward the target, when affixing the grip.
When folding the right hand over the left thumb, the left thumb will fit perfectly in the “cup” formed in the palm of the folded right hand.
The left thumb and the palm of the folded right hand fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle.
The completed two-hand grip is described.
The left thumb fits securely into the cup of the right palm.
The union of the left thumb and right thumb pad strengthens the welding together of the two hands.
The union of the left thumb and right thumb pad serves to add real reinforcement to the grip, particularly at the top of the backswing.
Poor grips are most likely to deteriorate at the top of the backswing.
When you check your right-hand grip, the V formed by the thumb and forefinger should be pointing right at the button of your chin.
The V of the right hand points to the chin.
The final word is about the potential swing-wreckers, the right forefinger and thumb.
The tips of the forefinger and thumb serve the advanced golfer as finesse fingers.
Learning to use the forefinger and thumb only for touch in striking the ball requires some training.
You will develop the talent of using the forefinger and thumb for touch as you progress.
At this stage of the game, breaking down bad habits and acquiring correct new habits is the paramount consideration.
There is no doubt in my mind that the average golfer should forget about the finesse business completely.
For the average golfer, the finesse business can do more harm than good in learning how to use the right hand.
An extremely beneficial exercise to practice is to grip the club and swing it with the right forefinger and thumb entirely off the shaft.
Practicing this exercise for perhaps five minutes daily for a week can be beneficial.
Gripping the club and swinging it with the right forefinger and thumb off the shaft gives the golfer a sense of having just one corporate hand on the club.
The ideal is to feel that the tips of the forefinger and thumb are hardly on the club after completing the grip.
Strive to build up the opposite feeling that the knuckle above the forefinger is pressing toward the thumb and the target.
We have provided detailed instructions on the elements of the correct grip for a reason.
In golf, players often mistake the generality for the detail.
Players may think that overlapping the finger is the detail and not pay enough attention to how they do it.
They may confuse an effect with the action that causes it.
Many golfers believe that if their two Vs are pointed correctly, their grip must be correct.
The direction of the Vs is no guarantee, simply a check point.
In golf, precision is required for certain actions, where being approximately right is not sufficient.
The grip is an area where being only partially correct does not help.
Cultivating the right habits makes gripping the club correctly easier.
Being meticulous about learning to grip the club brings significant rewards.
A correct grip, along with correct stance and posture, allows the hands to manage themselves during the swing.
A correct grip engages the proper muscles of the arms and body.
The speaker has personal experience with various grips in golf due to being born left-handed and later switching to right-handed.
The speaker started golfing left-handed because the first club owned was for left-handed players.
The speaker changed to a right-handed grip due to the lack of left-handed equipment available in their hometown.
Initially, the speaker used a cross-hand grip as a right-handed golfer.
The speaker then experimented with an interlocking grip before settling on the overlapping grip around the age of 15.
The overlapping grip was adopted after observing Ted Longworth's grip, who was the pro at the Glen Garden club.
The speaker recognized the overlapping grip as the best option and quickly became familiar with it.
Gripping the club with the right thumb and forefinger off shaft helps a golfer to accustom himself to the feeling of a strong, correct grip in which both hands work together as one unit.
The golfer adopted the overlapping grip.
Over the years since first adopting the overlapping grip, the golfer made two minor alterations.
Right after coming out of the service, the golfer changed from what is called the 'long thumb,' with the left thumb fully extended.
Someone made modifications to their golf grip in 1946.
The modifications involved contracting the left thumb and moving the left hand to the left.
The purpose of the modifications was to retain power while reducing a tendency to hook.
Moving the left hand over so that the thumb was down the middle of the shaft helped address the issue.
The person considers these changes beneficial and recommends them for golfers with a similar swing pattern.
The person views these changes as adjustments rather than fundamentals.
The effectiveness of the golf grip is influenced by how thin the hands and fingers feel.
Drinking ginger ale seems to prevent the hands from feeling too fat and puffy.
Cold weather affects the feel of the hands.
To keep hands warm at Carnoustie, the person carried hand-warmers in each pocket.
The hand-warmers also served to keep golf balls warm.
A warm golf ball flies farther than a cold one.
In the next lesson, modern fundamentals of stance and posture will be discussed.
At least 30 minutes of daily practice on the grip is recommended for a week.
Learning the next fundamentals will be easier and more valuable with this practice.
Intelligent application is necessary to learn the golf swing.
The average golfer can learn to put all the elements of the swing together.
By using the same method as a professional, the golfer can hit shots with the same basic character.
The average golfer may not be as long or accurate as a pro, but they can hit long and straight shots.
Correctly executed golf shots can have real character.
It is within the average person's power.
I cannot emphasize this point too strongly.
Once the average golfer is properly started on the correct method of hitting the golf ball, he will begin to improve.
Once the average golfer is properly started on the correct method of hitting the golf ball, he will begin to feel that improvement.
Once the average golfer is properly started on the correct method of hitting the golf ball, he will gradually find that he is able to hit fine, full shots.
Once the average golfer is properly started on the correct method of hitting the golf ball, he will gradually find that he is able to hit the ball high, low, draw it, fade it, play sand shots, recoveries, half shots — ALL THIS WITHOUT CHANGING HIS SWING.
The swing itself is what gives the average golfer this feel for managing this full variety of golf shots.
If the average golfer's grip is faulty, he won't have control of the club when he reaches the top of his backswing.
If his grip is correct, the club will be held perfectly under control at the top of the player’s backswing.
The grip belongs to the player.
With fulcrum at the end of the shaft, the center of gravity is changed and the clubhead feels much heavier.
The fulcrum is at the end of the shaft.
As he improves, the average golfer will enjoy the game more and more.
The average golfer is the one improving.
A correct swing will enable him to rediscover golf — in fact, to discover golf for the first time.
He will have the necessary equipment.
The full vocabulary for golf will introduce him to a different game entirely.
He will know he can carry 200 yards of water any old time.
He'll be able to think about more advanced things like how much of the water hazard to cut off.
He'll consider the best position across the water to play his second shot on the hole.
The strategy implicit on every good golf hole will appeal to him.
He'll understand the reason why a tree is standing along the left edge of the fairway.
He'll see the purpose of a trap edging into the opening to the green.
He'll comprehend why the fairway narrows at certain points.
He will not want changes to the course like cutting down trees or altering traps.
He will object to any plans to soften up the rough.
He will absorb the spirit of the game.
When faced with a difficult shot due to a poor shot, he'll respond to the challenge.
If there's a small opening to the green, he will rise to the challenge of hitting a more accurate shot.
He will have confidence in his essentially correct, repeating swing.
With moderate concentration, he can produce the required shot.
Despite being human, he will make errors.
Golf will be a source of ever-increasing pleasure for him.
The great fascination of golf is the instinctive feeling a player gets soon after he has taken the game up that there is an explanation for everything that takes place.
A player feels that the mystery of how to hit the ball well and hit it well regularly is not mysterious at all.
It is possible to arrive at answers that will be as clear-cut and irrefutable as the solution the master detective unfolds in the last chapter of a mystery novel.
All of us, quite like detectives, set off on our own separate paths.
We develop a clue here, put it to the test to see if it holds up, develop another lead there, and test this lead in turn to see if it will hold up.
Today’s brilliant deduction all too often folds under deeper examination and becomes tomorrow’s dead end.
With no trouble at all, you can get off on the wrong track, increase your error by studiously taking the wrong turn at another crucial fork in the road, and before you know it, you are lost in a labyrinth of your own making.
The only true mystery to golf is the essential magnetism the game possesses which makes so many of us, regardless of discouragement, never quite turn in our trench coats and magnifying glasses and stop our search for the answers.
Golf seems to bring out the scientist in a person.
A person soon discovers that unless he goes about observing and testing with an orderly method, he is simply complicating his problems.
In this general connection, it helps immensely to bring along a notebook and pencil to the practice tee and to write down after each session just what it was being worked on, exactly how it was coming, and precisely where it was that should be resumed for testing the next time going out to practice.
I will probably keep on studying golf all my life, but I honestly feel that I have now acquired a sound understanding of the game that will be of real value to all golfers.
I wish I had known what I know today when I was a youngster just starting out!
No one can play good golf unless he has a correct, powerful, repeating swing.
A man or woman of average coordination can build such a swing if he or she goes about it sensibly.
Learning and practicing a few fundamentals is crucial until performing them becomes almost as instinctive as walking.
The swing being taught has been stripped down to the authentic essentials.
The only “technical” thing about this swing is the explanation.
There is a definite purpose behind every movement.
The first inclusive fundamental is the grip.
The grip has already been discussed.
The second fundamental is the stance and the posture.
Many golfers make the error of thinking of the stance as merely lining up on the target in the swing preparation.
The stance not only sets up the direction of the shot but also serves other important functions.
Power and control must be combined in a good golf swing.
The stance helps the golfer be in balance throughout the swing, have muscles ready to perform fluidly, and channel all energy into producing maximum control and power.
Little individual movements of feet, knees, or shoulders when settling into the stance by a fine player are not empty gestures of nervousness.
These movements are not preceding a static, fixed position but are about feeling balanced and poised for action in the swing.
The proper stance enables a golfer to be perfectly balanced throughout the swing.
The proper posture enables a golfer to be poised throughout the swing.
Being perfectly balanced and poised allows a golfer's legs, arms, and body to carry out their interrelated assignments correctly.
A golfer steps up to the ball to play a shot.
The golfer already has his grip on the club.
The golfer should be getting the feel of the weight of the club from the moment he took it from his bag.
The golfer first aligns himself before taking a shot.
The face of his club aligns with his target.
He shuffles into position for the upcoming shot aligning himself with the face of the club.
The adjustment of the feet, the legs, the body, the arms, and hands is done simultaneously and interdependently.
For the purposes of instruction, each aspect will be addressed individually, starting with the feet.
The feet should be set apart the width of the shoulders when playing a standard five-iron shot.
The feet are set somewhat closer together when playing the more lofted clubs, and somewhat wider than the width of the shoulders when playing the long irons and the woods.
Spreading the feet too far apart may result in over-extending the legs, potentially locking them at joints that should remain supple.
Most golfers tend to take too narrow a stance.
A fairly wide stance is advocated as it provides a firmer foundation for traction and balance and allows the shoulders to operate more freely than a narrow stance.
The feet should be set apart the width of the shoulders when the golfer prepares to play a standard five-iron shot.
Some tournament-caliber golfers stand with the toes of both feet pointed out.
You may have noticed that some tournament-caliber golfers choose to stand with the toes of both feet pointed out.
It has always struck me that these players succeed in spite of the placement of their feet.
I have been convinced since my early days in golf that there is one correct basic stance.
The right foot is at a right angle.
The angle to the line of flight is important.
The left foot is turned out a quarter of a turn to the left.
The term 'a quarter of a turn' may be confusing.
Placing the left foot so that the toe points right at the target amounts to a full 90-degree turn from a position perpendicular to the line of flight.
A quarter of a turn signifies a quarter of that 90-degree angle, or about 22 degrees to the left of perpendicular.
A player employing this stance positions his body better for the downswing when the club is coming into the ball in the direction his left foot is going.
Looking at a good golfer's stance reveals where he is aiming to hit his shot.
Most pros tend to tilt their bodies a little toward the target at address.
A golfer who stands with both feet turned out makes it unclear whether he is hitting the ball right-handed or left-handed.
The stance of a golfer with both feet turned out gives no clue about the direction he's going.
Obeying the basic stance accomplishes several very important things.
The full value of obeying the basic stance will become clearer and clearer as the lessons progress.
The basic stance makes it appreciably easier for the golfer, as he goes into his backswing, to feel and control the muscles that should initiate the swing.
The correct stance acts as a perfect automatic governor on the amount of hip turn the golfer can take (and should take) on the backswing.
The correct stance allows the hips to be rotated as far around as is advisable, but it prevents them from being rotated too far around.
If the player stands with his left foot squared (or perpendicular) and not turned out as it should be, the hips will turn well beyond the point of maximum desirable rotation.
If a player’s right foot is turned out instead of squared, this also allows his hips to turn further around than is advisable.
When practicing the hip turn, starting from the correct basic stance and completing a full hip turn, the belt buckle should point toward the toe of the squared right foot.
Starting from the faulty stances described above, the hip turn will carry the player well past the check point, and the belt buckle will be pointing in almost the exact opposite direction from the target.
The stance also affects the downswing a great deal.
By standing with his right foot pointed out, a player makes it much harder for himself to bring the club swiftly and smoothly.
Someone has obstructed his own passage forward.
He has to go on a detour out and around his right hip to get past the ball.
Someone makes things hard for himself if he stands with his left foot squared and not turned out that vital quarter of a turn.
If someone stands with his left foot squared, his left leg and his whole body feel uncomfortably restricted when he’s hitting through the ball.
Instead of everything moving cohesively and freely toward the target, everything is grinding under strain.
If someone's left foot is correctly positioned, he can go through the ball with everything he’s got, he can release the whole works.
There isn’t an ounce of energy that isn’t imparted to the ball.
An apparently insignificant detail like the position of the left foot can affect someone's entire swing for better or for worse.
The explanation for this is anatomical.
Certain muscles of the body connect with certain other muscles.
When someone uses one muscle in a certain chain, he also activates the others that are connected with it.
Some sets of muscles should be active in the golf swing, and some other sets of muscles have no real business in the swing.
For example, when a golfer overturns his hips going back, he has to call on incorrect sources of power, like his right shoulder, to get some force into his shot.
When a golfer brings these incorrect forces into his swing, his coordination breaks down.
By using wrong muscles, he necessarily curtails the correct functioning of the correct muscles.
It is important to develop the right habits and proper muscle memory.
The way the parts of the body function in the golf swing is not unlike a Western movie with heroes and villains: if you set it up so that the good guys take over, the bad guys can’t.
The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in 1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in other parts of Germany until the 18th century.
Scholar Richard Sermon writes that hares were frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition that hares laid eggs, since a hare’s scratch or form and a lapwing’s nest look very similar, and both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe. German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the Easter Bunny.
The incorrect positioning of the right foot can lead to many serious errors.
The errors include dipping the left knee, swaying the right leg out to the right, turning the hips excessively, and making a forced, incorrect shoulder turn as the left arm breaks.
During the swing, one of the two arms is always straight — that is, fully extended.
There’s a very good reason for this.
In order for the club to travel its maximum arc, one arm must be extended at all times.
If a player breaks his left elbow on the backswing or breaks his right elbow on the follow-through, he shortens his arc appreciably.
If he swings with a shorter arc, he gives himself a shorter distance in which he can accelerate the speed with which his club is traveling.
The greater the speed of the club, the greater the distance he will hit the ball.
If you accelerate an automobile over a distance of, say, two blocks, you cannot get it up to anywhere like the speed you’d obtain if you accelerated it for a distance of five blocks.
Moreover, if one of the player’s two arms is always extended, his arc will be uniform.
This gives him a far better chance of building a repeating swing than a player who bends his arms a little differently on each swing and whose coordination is bound to vary as his arc varies.
The left arm, straight at address, remains straight throughout the backswing while the right folds in at the elbow.
On the downswing, the left continues to be fully extended and the right gradually straightens out.
A foot or so past the ball, the point in the swing when the clubhead is traveling at its peak speed, both arms are fully extended for the one and only time during the swing.
After this point is reached, the left arm folds in at the elbow and the right remains straight to the end of the follow-through.
All during the swing, until it begins to fold at that point beyond impact, the left arm ideally should operate as if it were an extension of the shaft.
Naturally, there must be some suppleness, some break in your left wrist.
The left arm should be straight, but this doesn’t mean that it should be locked at the wrist or elbow or be any place as stiff as the arm of a robot.
This is a very pleasant game, and unnatural straining isn’t at all necessary or desirable.
The correct left-arm position is important in the golf swing.
The correct left-arm position is important in the golf swing from a front view.
The correct left-arm position is important in the golf swing from a side view.
In the golf swing, the arms act as the connection between the club and the body.
The closer you keep your two arms together, the better they will operate as one unit.
When the arms operate as one unit, they tend to pull all of the elements of the swing together.
The upper part of the arms should be pressed tightly against the sides of the chest.
In the author's own case, there is conscious effort to build up a strong adhesion between the upper arms and the chest.
A person would have to exert a really terrific amount of force to wedge the upper arms and the chest apart.
The elbows should be tucked in, not stuck out from the body.
At address, the left elbow should point.
Directly at the left hipbone, the right elbow should point directly at the right hipbone.
There should be a sense of fixed jointness between the two forearms and the wrists.
This sense of fixed jointness should be maintained throughout the swing.
A word of emphasis is given about the elbows.
You want to press the elbows as closely together as you can.
When you press the elbows closely together (and the elbows are pointing properly to the hipbones), you will notice that the 'pocket' of each elbow — the small depression on the inside of the joint — will lie in the center of the arm, at the midway point.
The pockets of the elbows will be facing toward the sky, as they should, not toward each other.
It’s a good check.
In this position of address, though the left arm hangs relatively straight, the right arm should be broken a little at the elbow as the elbow points in.
On the backswing, this right elbow must not fly out, and only if it is correctly positioned at address will it be able to fold in close to the body.
During the first half of the backswing, the right elbow should move hardly at all.
The right elbow mustn’t slide out laterally or slip back along the right side.
As the right elbow folds close to the body, the elbow should always be pointing toward the ground.
It helps, you will find if the upper part of the right arm adheres as closely as possible to the side of the chest.
Keep the elbows as close together as possible throughout the entire swing.
Keep the arms as close together as possible throughout the entire swing.
Two cross-sectional drawings show the relationship of the elbows to the hips.
When your arms are set right at address, it makes it immeasurably easier to get the proper function out of the arms.
With practice, the arms will act the same way on swing after swing, with no variation, repeating the same action almost like a machine.
Your arms become schooled, and you will get the feeling that the arms and the club form one firm unit.
The two arms are equal sides of a triangle, with the club emerging like the spire of a steeple at the peak point where the arms join.
As you practice, your arms will recognize with increasing certainness when they are on the right track as they swing back and then forward.
You will feel more and more surely that 'this swing is bound to go away from the ball and come back through the ball very nearly the same way every time.'
Before we go into the final phase of stance and posture — how a golfer’s legs and his body in general should be flexed as he positions himself over the ball — is perhaps the right time and place to interject a brief comment on that greatly overworked and abused word relaxation.
A hypothesis is made that achieving proper relaxation in golf is harder than in any other sport.
Being in motion helps an athlete tremendously to relax.
The average golfer experiences understandable anxiety about performing the swing correctly from the next static start.
The chief reason for the golfer's worry around the golf course is the uncertainty about swinging correctly.
At address, the right elbow points directly to the right hipbone.
The elbow can then fold in correctly on the backswing.
At address, the left elbow points directly to the left hipbone.
There are several ways for a golfer to address the problem, all connected with understanding what the swing is really about.
A golfer can help himself to address this problem.
Realizing that pure relaxation is something the golfer can’t attain and shouldn’t want to will help him right away.
There is nothing wrong with a person if he feels a bit keyed up when he goes out to play golf.
It is natural for a person to feel a bit keyed up when going out to play golf.
The person is going to be doing something that takes some concentration and effort.
The person shouldn't want to attain pure relaxation because he will be doing something that takes some concentration and effort.
Topnotch competitive golfers are not totally relaxed.
Each topnotch competitive golfer feels the pressure of tournament play.
Topnotch competitive golfers have different temperaments.
They absorb the pressure in their individual ways.
Topnotch competitive golfers include Jones, Nelson, Demaret, Middlecoff, Snead, Sarazen, and Armour.
There is another type of relaxation called active relaxation.
Fine competitive golfers manage to be actively relaxed as they prepare to play a shot.
Fine competitive golfers have live tension in the parts of the body that will be doing the work.
Fine competitive golfers tune up the muscles they will be using.
Fine competitive golfers tune up their muscles like a musician tunes up his instrument.
The fact that there is something to do, rather than something not to do, is helpful for fine competitive golfers.
When he assumes the 'semi-sitting position,' the upper part of the player's trunk remains relatively erect as he bends at the knees.

The knees point in.
The sit-down motion is like lowering yourself (about two inches) onto a spectator-sports-stick.
Numerous average golfers fail to realize that an incorrect stance greatly affects the success of the entire swing.
Numerous average golfers fail to realize that faulty posture greatly affects the success of the entire swing.
The golfer is off balance from the start if he keeps his legs stiff.
The golfer is off balance from the start if he lets his knees buckle.
The golfer is off balance from the start if he crouches his shoulders way over the ball.
The average player can learn to prepare himself for his shot.
The average player can position himself for his shot.
The tournament player can learn to prepare himself for his shot.
The tournament player can position himself for his shot.
Muscular system is all set to work correctly.
Above all, his knees must be properly flexed.
The legs must be supple.
At the same time, the legs must have this live tension.
The rest of the body will pick up this athletic temper from the legs.
When his knees are flexed as they should be, a player can move his hips and shoulders with a real sense of ease.
All the movements become easier and more integrated.
Fine golfers often remark that the days they play their best golf are those days when their legs are really ready and eager for action.
Assuming the proper posture as he addresses the ball is a purposeful movement.
In this movement, a player lowers his body from its normal erect position into a sturdier and more balanced position for executing the golf swing.
Do not use your hips as you bend your knees.
You should bend your knees from the thighs down.
As your knees bend, the upper part of the trunk remains normally erect, just as it does when you sit down in a chair.
In golf, the sit-down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator-sports-stick.
Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks.
In this semi-sitting position, your body should feel in balance both laterally and back-to-front.
You should feel a sense of heaviness in your buttocks.
There should be more tension in your legs from the knees down.
The lower part of your legs should feel very springy and strong, loaded with elastic energy.
Your weight should be a bit more on the heels than on the balls of your feet.
If you wanted to, you would be able to lift your toes inside your shoes.
The back remains as naturally erect as it is when you’re walking down a fairway.
Do not crouch the shoulders over the ball.
You bend your head down only by bending your neck, not your back or shoulders.
When you practice this semi-sitting position, have a golf club in your hands and go about it exactly as if you were getting ready to play a shot.
When you are standing erect before the ball, with your arms normally extended, the head of the club will be raised about four inches above the ball.
As you lower yourself into the semi-sitting position, your upper trunk should feel like it’s an elevator dropping down a floor.
The clubhead descends as your trunk descends.
When you have completed the semi-squat, the clubhead should be an inch or more below the ball.
Two hands set the clubhead behind the ball.
The knees work 'toward each other' during the golf swing.
Start the knees with each knee pointing in.
Starting with the knees pointing in is a valuable shortcut as it requires minimal movement during the swing.
The right knee should be broken a shade more in to the left than the left knee is to the right.
If the right knee is pointed in, it helps brace the right leg on the backswing.
The right knee must be sturdily braced to prevent lateral swaying to the right during the swing.
The right knee will be in the correct position for the downswing when the power of the right hip and leg is released toward the target.
If the golfer's right knee is pointed straight ahead or out, it can bring it in with a separate action on the downswing.
Having the left knee pointed in a bit at address is essential for proper left-leg action on both the backswing and downswing.
A correct stance and posture ensure that legs, arms, and body are properly balanced and positioned for the swing.
Live tension in arm and leg muscles is felt when they function actively during the swing.
The muscles to work with are the 'inside muscles' along the inside of the legs, thighs, and arms.
Acquiring a sound golf swing may seem slow and painstaking but can be learned quicker with the right approach.
Some patience is required to learn the fundamentals of golf.
Learning the grip, stance, and posture clearly is essential before advancing in golf.
In fact, the best way to learn golf is similar to learning to play the piano.
You practice a few things daily to build a solid foundation.
You then move on to practicing more advanced things daily to increase your skill.
Practice at home can be more enjoyable and equally beneficial if done with a fellow golfer, such as your wife, son, daughter, or golfing friend.
Each person can take turns checking the other's progress and helping them correct errors.
Teaching is a good way to clarify things for yourself.
If you prefer practicing alone, using a full-length mirror is recommended as the best way to check your movements.

However you choose to practice, bear in mind that the end objective is to build a sound swing.
The end objective is to build a swing with only superficial good looks.
I do not claim that I have a model swing.
I do not claim that I have a perfect swing.
I think I know the ingredients that make one.
If you learn and apply the precepts these lessons teach, this does not mean that your swing will necessarily be, minute action for minute action, a literal duplicate of mine.
My way of executing a fundamental is bound to be somewhat different from what is natural execution for a player whose build or muscular arrangement is different from mine.
The big idea is for you to execute the fundamentals properly so that you will have a swing that functions properly.
Style is function and function is style.
There is a basic resemblance among all fine golfers.
Despite their personal mannerisms, in major ways they all do the same things.
The 'style' you evolve may instantly recall Harry Cooper or Mac Smith to your golfing friends, and that wouldn’t be such a bad thing at all.
The First Part of the Swing is about golf professionals who dedicate their time either to teaching the game or to competing in tournaments.
Some persons who have made golf their career devote the major portion of their working hours to teaching the game.
In contrast to the 'home pro,' other members of the profession are tournament golfers who follow the circuit.
Being a specialist in golf is necessary due to the keen competition in tournaments.
Keeping oneself tuned up for tournament golf takes all of a man’s time nowadays.
Preparing for tournaments and participating in them consumed practically all the author's time and energies.
The demands of being a tournament golfer were all-encompassing, leaving the author with no extra time for teaching.
The author often wondered if they would have been a first-class teacher of golf if the demands of tournament golf were not so all-encompassing.
The author didn't have the ideal temperament for teaching compared to natural teachers like Henry Picard, Claude Harmon, and Al Watrous.
The author considered themselves a fair teacher, especially for students serious about improving their game.
The general approach to teaching followed by the author was to explain to players what they ought to be doing, why it is correct, and the result it produces.
A teacher is as good as the pupil's ability to work and learn.
A young businessman named Fred Ehrman at the author's club had the ability to learn and improve his game significantly with the author's guidance.
Fred Ehrman was a 90-shooter in April and significantly improved five months later.
Someone won the club championship in the 70s.
The winner of the club championship was not a fluke.
The next season, the winner was beaten in the final of the club championship by Carl Loeb Jr.
Carl Loeb Jr. was the person who beat the winner in the final of the club championship.
The improvement in the winner's game took place in 1938 and 1939.
By 1939, the winner believed to know quite well the true fundamentals of the golf swing.
The winner's knowledge in 1939 was less integrated than it later became.
In 1946, the winner truly understood the dynamics of the golf swing.
Starting in 1946, the winner was able to win some big championships.
The ability to win championships was the proof the winner needed to confirm the correctness of their beliefs.
A correct swing can stand the pressure of competition day after day.
The winner feels confident that their understanding of the true fundamentals of golf is correct because competition proved it to be right.
If the golfer executes his backswing correctly, at the top of his backswing his legs, hips, shoulders, arms and hands will be properly poised and interrelated to move with power and coordination into that climactic part of the golf swing, the downswing.
Every golfer, no matter how sound his game, must expect to experience some ups and downs.
Being a human being, every golfer cannot always be at the peak of his game.
Every golfer will win his share of tournaments.
There are bound to be occasions when every golfer cannot keep pace with some of his wonderfully talented colleagues who that week happen to be at the peak of their games.
The fundamentals of golf fall into four natural groupings: those that relate to the grip, to the stance and posture, to the first part of the swing (from address to the top of the backswing), and to the.
The second part of the swing goes from the start of the downswing to the finish of the follow-through.
This phase of the swing requires some instinct.
This phase of the swing requires a sense of organization.
This phase of the swing requires some thought.
This phase of the swing requires a fair control of muscular action.
This phase of the swing is much less involved than it appears.
Learning the backswing actually consists of getting a few movements clear in your mind.
Learning the backswing involves learning to execute the clear movements.
The golf shot begins to be played during the backswing.
The first point about the backswing I want to emphasize is this: if his body, legs, and arms are properly positioned and poised to begin with, any golfer with average physical equipment can learn to execute the proper movements.
A correct grip and stance are essential to build on for the golf swing.
The golf swing is an accumulative thing.
All the actions in the golf swing are linked together.
When the grip is correct, there will be proper live tension in the arm muscles.
The arm muscles that should be worked with in the golf swing are the ones along the inside of the arms all the way to the armpit.
Coordinated movement results from using the correct muscles in the golf swing.
The inside muscles stretching from the ankle to the thigh are the right ones for golf.
When a player uses the correct leg muscles, his left knee will break in correctly to the right on the backswing.
Correct movements make it easier to execute other moves correctly.
With practice, the movements in the golf swing will blend harmoniously together and fuse into one smooth overall movement.
A bad swing is tiring drudgery.
A good swing is a physical pleasure.
The bridge between the address and the actual start of the backswing is 'the waggle.'
As a golfer looks at his objective and figures out the kind of shot he’s going to play, his instinct takes over.
The waggle is an extremely important part of shotmaking.
The waggle is more than just loosening up; it is a sort of miniature practice swing.
The waggle is an abbreviated 'dry run' for the upcoming shot.
The golfer takes the club back on the waggle.
The golfer accustoms himself to the path the club will be taking on his actual backswing.
The face of the clubhead will be coming into the ball square and on the line.
During the waggle, the golfer previews his shot and attempts to telegraph his mental picture from his brain to his muscles.
The golfer makes the little adjustments necessary to be perfectly in balance for hitting that particular shot from that particular lie.
The golfer tunes himself up and tones himself up for his swing as he waggles.
The shoulders do not turn during the waggle.
The feet make only small adjusting movements.
The hands and arms move as they waggle the club.
The hands and arms pass their rhythm, their tempo of coordination, on to the legs and feet.
The trunk of the body and the shoulders pick up this beat smoothly from the arms and the legs.
The whole body becomes synchronized to the rhythm in which the various parts will be working cohesively together during the swing.
The golfer can practically rehearse the swing they’ll be using by taking full advantage of the opportunity the waggle affords.
The golfer sometimes concentrated so hard on the shot they were going to hit that they honestly felt the shot could not fail to come off exactly as intended.
The golfer had the definite sensation that they had really hit the shot before even starting the club back on some occasions.
In the waggle, the left hand is the controlling hand.
The right hand works along with the left hand.
The right elbow should hit the front part of the right hip, just about where the watch pocket is, each time the golfer waggles the club back.
When this takes place, the left elbow comes out slightly, the lower part of the arm from the elbow down rotates a little, and the left hand moves three inches or so past the ball toward the target.
As the hands move back to the ball on the forward waggle, the left hand also moves an inch or two past the ball toward the target.
During the waggle, the upper part of the arms remain rooted against the sides of the chest.
There should be no turning of the shoulders.
Left hand moves past the ball toward the target on the back waggle.
Left hand moves past the ball toward the target on the forward waggle.
A good golfer is adjusting to the shot during the waggle.
A good golfer is establishing coordination during the waggle.
A good golfer is conducting an instinctive roll call of the body parts he will be using during the swing.
He is alerting the body parts and refreshing their memory of the movements they’ll be making during the swing.
The rhythm of the waggle varies with each shot played.
Preparations for each shot must be done instinctively.
The golfer is 130 yards out from a semiplateau green.
The golfer has decided to get the ball well up in the air in a steep trajectory.
The golfer will be playing a seven-iron.
The golfer wants to hit a soft, feathery kind of shot that will float down onto the green.
The golfer will waggle somewhat slowly and somewhat softly.
The tempo used during the waggle will be the same as the tempo used on the stroke.
The golfer has to bang a drive low into the wind on a hole where it’s important to be out a good distance from the tee to get home in two.
The golfer will move the club back.
During the waggle, the shoulders do not turn.
The waggle fits the shot.
You'll swing that way with much more briskness, more conviction, more speed.
On the actual swing, the hands, arms, and shoulders start to move almost simultaneously on the backswing.
The hands, arms, and shoulders are parts of the body that move almost simultaneously on the backswing.
The waggle gives the golfer a running start.
The waggle is a movement that gives the golfer a running start.
The waggle blends right into the swing.
The waggle smoothly transitions into the swing.
For all general points and purposes, the backswing is simply an extension of the way the golfer takes the club back on the waggle.
The backswing is essentially a continuation of how the golfer moves the club back during the waggle.
The club follows that same path, and it is swung back at the speed the waggle has regulated.
The club follows the same path as in the waggle and is swung back at the speed set by the waggle.
There is, however, one significant difference between the waggle and the backswing which must be made crystal clear.
There is a notable distinction between the waggle and the backswing that needs clarification.
During the waggle, the shoulders do not turn.
The shoulders do not turn during the waggle.
On the actual swing, the shoulders do turn, right from the beginning of the backswing.
The shoulders do turn on the actual swing, starting from the beginning of the backswing.
The backswing is, in fact, initiated by the almost simultaneous movement of the hands, arms, and shoulders.
The backswing actually begins with the nearly simultaneous movement of the hands, arms, and shoulders.
Introducing the shoulders does not alter the pattern you set up in the waggle.
Including the shoulders in the movement does not change the pattern established during the waggle.
By turning your shoulders on your actual backswing, you simply increase the arc of your waggle.
When you turn your shoulders during the actual backswing, you expand the arc of your waggle.
Throughout these lessons, we have placed special emphasis on the fact that the golf swing is, in principle, a continuous chain of actions.
Throughout the lessons, there is a strong emphasis on the idea that the golf swing is fundamentally a sequence of continuous actions.
The component parts of the swing fuse together and work together in a purposeful sequence.
The component parts of the swing are like the component parts of the engine of an automobile.
Each component of the swing sets up the proper operation of the other components it is connected to as it performs its part of the operation.
A golfer will play good golf if they clearly grasp the interrelationship of the hands, arms, shoulders, and hips.
The order of movement on the backswing goes like this: hands, arms, shoulders, hips.
On the downswing, the order of movement is reversed: hips, shoulders, arms, hands.
On the backswing, the hands, arms, and shoulders start to move almost simultaneously.
The hands start the clubhead back a split second before the arms start back.
The arms begin their movement a split second before the shoulders begin to turn.
As a golfer acquires feel and rhythm through practice, the hands, arms, and shoulders will instinctively tie in on this split-second schedule.
For the novice golfer, the main point is to know that the hands, arms, and shoulders start back so closely together that their action is unified.
On the backswing, the shoulders are always ahead of the hips as they turn.
The shoulders start turning immediately, but the hips do not.
Just before the hands reach hip level, the shoulders, as they turn, automatically start pulling the hips around.
As the hips begin to turn, they pull the left leg in to the right.
The shoulders need to turn as far around as they can go.
When the shoulders have turned all the way, the back should face squarely towards the target.
Most golfers think they make a full shoulder turn going back, but few really complete their shoulder turn.
Sam Snead can turn his shoulders a shade farther around than most golfers, which is fine.
The more a golfer can turn their shoulders, the better.
Golfers often stop turning their shoulders when they are about halfway around and then break the left arm to get the clubhead all the way back, which is a false backswing.
A golfer can't have control of the club or start down if they don't complete the shoulder turn.
Before swinging the golf club, the player should ensure that his left arm is straight.
When the player bends his left arm during the swing, he only performs a half swing and loses half of his potential power.
Bending the left arm unnecessarily leads to extra movements that are tiring and ineffective.
A way to confirm a full shoulder turn is to make sure that the chin hits the top of the left shoulder at the end of the backswing.
The point of contact between the chin and the shoulder varies based on the golfer's physical proportions.
In the speaker's case, the chin hits about an inch from the end of the shoulder, causing a worn-down spot on his golf shirts.
Prematurely turning the hips during the swing is a common and serious mistake that many golfers make.
Early hip rotation hinders the golfer from generating the power a properly coordinated swing provides.
At the start of the backswing, the hips should be kept still until the shoulders begin to rotate, pulling the hips along.
Some golfers suggest a significant hip turn, but the speaker disagrees with this approach.
Over-rotating the hips prevents the build-up of tension between the hips and shoulders, which is crucial for the downswing.
The tension in the mid-section of the body is essential for initiating the downswing.
During the downswing, the hips should turn back to the left to unleash the stored-up tension in the muscles between the hips and shoulders.
The increased tension in the hips unwinds the upper body, starting with the shoulders, then the arms, and finally the hands in a precise sequence.
This unwinding motion greatly aids the swing, almost making it automatic.
The tension accumulated in the shoulders, arms, and hands during the backswing is released in the correct order during the downswing, enhancing the power of the swing.
The correct order of movement on the backswing is hands, arms, shoulders, hips.
The golfer is shown waggling, returning to address, and then swinging to the top of his backswing.
Each drawing emphasizes the parts of the body actively functioning at each stage of the backswing.
The diagram above each drawing denotes the relative amount of turn of the shoulders and hips at each progressive stage of the backswing.
When the hips are turned back to the left, this action tightens the muscles between the hips and the shoulders.
This tightening is likened to the way a fellow gives each lug that little extra tightening twist when changing a tire.
Maximum tension in the muscles between the hips and the shoulders results in maximum speed.
Tighter tension in these muscles leads to faster unwinding of the upper body, transferring speed to the arms and hands.
The upper body gains a running start from this speed, ultimately producing clubhead speed.
Clubhead speed is what produces distance.
It is important to have torsion and stretching of the muscles from turning the shoulders as far as possible while retarding the hips on the backswing.
The difference in the amount of turn between the shoulders and hips creates this muscular tension.
Hips were turned as much as the shoulders.
The legs are involved in the movement of the feet.
When the hips enter the swing, they pull the left leg in.
The left knee breaks in towards the right.
The left foot rolls in towards the right on the inside part of the sole.
The weight on the left leg rests on the inside ball of the foot.
Caution against lifting the left heel too high off the ground on the backswing.
If the left heel stays on the ground or comes up an inch off the ground, it's fine.
Don't lift the left heel higher than an inch to avoid faulty balance and complications.
The body and legs should be allowed to move the feet.
The left knee breaking in on the backswing determines how much the left heel comes up.
Ignore the position of the left heel during the swing.
The right leg should maintain its address position and angle in relation to the ground throughout the backswing.
Check to ensure the right leg and knee remain stable and prevent swaying to the right.
The plane of the swing is more important than the arc.
There are two planes in the golf swing: the backswing plane and the downswing plane.
The backswing plane is described as an angle of inclination from the ball to the shoulders.
The pitch of the angle is determined by the height of the shoulders and the distance from the ball at address.
Golfer can check stability of his right leg by marking its angle at address with club.
The golfer can note if the angle of the club changes when he practices the backswing motion.
On the backswing, the plane serves the golfer as a sort of a three-dimensional road map.
The shoulders should rotate on this plane, continuously inclined at the same angle they established at address.
En route from address to the top of the backswing, the arms and hands (and the club) should also remain on this same angle of inclination as they swing back.
The left arm can be used as a guide for this angle.
When the shoulders, arms, and hands follow the appointed route the plane sets up, it ensures that the upper body and arms will be correctly inter-aligned when they reach the crucial point where the backswing ends and the downswing begins.
The downswing is inaugurated by the hips, and the turning hips unwind the upper part of the body, followed by the shoulders, arms, and then the hands flowing easily and powerfully into the swing.
By staying on his backswing plane, the player pre-groups his forces so that each component is correctly geared to work with the other components on the downswing.
The energy of the hips, shoulders, arms, and hands will be released in the correct order, resulting in a perfect chain action.
The golfer can put everything he has into the shot and obtain maximum distance and accuracy.
When powered up to begin with and generating immense power as the downswing accelerates, there is no need to try and manufacture some power with some last-ditch swing-wrecking effort, as poor golfers are forced to do.
This kind of misplaced effort can be avoided.
Produces very little in the way of distance and damages direction left and right.
Golf becomes a frustrating game because you get so little in return for the energy you put into your shots.
For the golfer with a correct swing who pre-arranges his chain action by staying on his backswing plane and storing his power properly, golf is a tremendous pleasure.
He reaps the full rewards for the effort he pours into golf.
There is no such thing as an absolute and standard plane for all golfers.
The correct angle for each person’s plane depends on how he is built.
A fellow whose legs are proportionately shorter than his arms creates a shallow angle for his plane.
A man whose legs are proportionately longer than his arms sets up a very steep angle for himself.
Neither plane is incorrect.
It is wrong to term the man who properly swings on a shallow plane a “flat swinger” or the man who properly swings on a steep plane an “upright swinger” simply because their planes happen to be flatter or more upright than the plane of the man of more average proportions.
If any golfer permits his arms and his club to drop well below his established plane, then, whether he normally possesses a shallow or steep or an average plane, he would be swinging too flat.
If he hoists his club above the line of his plane, he would be swinging too upright.
The best way to visualize what the plane is and how it influences the swing is to imagine that, as the player stands before the ball at address, his head sticks out through a hole in an immense pane of glass that rests on his shoulders as it inclines upward from the ball.
When a golfer executes his backswing properly, as his arms are approaching hip level, they should be parallel with the plane and they should remain parallel with the plane, just beneath the glass, till they reach the top of the backswing.
At the top of his backswing, his left arm should be extended at the exact same angle to the ball as the glass.
His left arm would brush against the glass.
As for his shoulders, as they turn on the backswing, the top of the shoulders will continuously be brushing against the glass.
Visualize the backswing plane as a large pane of glass resting on the shoulders, inclining upward from the ball.
The large pane of glass is a visualization of the backswing plane.
The backswing plane inclines upward from the ball and rests on the shoulders.
As the arms approach hip level on the backswing, they should be moving parallel with the plane.
The arms should remain parallel with the plane [just below the glass] to the top of the backswing.
It would be ideal if the arms could be swung back parallel to the plane from the very start of the swing.
Because of the way human beings are constructed, a man gripping a club can’t get his arms onto the plane until they are nearly hip high.
The backswing plane runs from the ball through the shoulders.
The backswing plane is not too injurious if the club and arms travel on a plane a little flatter than the ideal one.
If you thrust your arms up above the plane so that they would shatter the pane of glass, you are heading for disaster.
Poor golfers make the error of thrusting their arms above the plane at any and all stages of the backswing.
The error of thrusting arms above the plane occurs most commonly when golfers are nearing the top of the backswing.
When golfers are nearing the top of the backswing, they suddenly lift their arms almost vertically towards the sky.
The glass shatters and the shot is affected when golfers lift their arms almost vertically towards the sky.
Golfers conclude the backswing on an entirely different and far more upright plane.
Golfers finish the backswing with their hands, forearms, and elbows pretzeled all over the place.
Golfers struggle to right themselves on the downswing when they are hopelessly out of position.
Talented golfers also make the mistake of looping their arms above the plane as they approach the top of the backswing.
The mistake of looping arms above the plane explains the frequent erratic spells of talented golfers.
Golfers who loop their arms above the plane cannot groove their compensations.
Golfers who loop their arms above the plane make errors on both sides of the fairway.
The drawings above demonstrate that the arms and club remain below the glass in all stages of backswing.
The drawings below demonstrate that the arms and club remain below the glass in all stages of backswing.
If you can devote a half hour a day for a week to practicing the backswing, you will begin to assimilate the correct movements quickly.
Devote a half hour a day for a week to practicing the backswing.
When we move on to study the second part of the swing, you will be far enough advanced to extract maximum profit.
Practice the waggle for perhaps 10 minutes a day.
I’d like to add one contingent thought in this connection.
The average player does one or two key things correctly purely by accident on some days when getting ready to hit a shot.
The average player feels uncomfortable and unconfident on most days when addressing the ball.
The average player is completely baffled when trying to figure out the remedies for this discomfort.
He rationalizes in his bewilderment, 'I just don’t have it today.'
The average player has it that day when checking the grip, stance, and waggles properly.
Practice a training exercise designed to school a golfer to entrust the swing to the arms and body, not the hands.
Start in the position of address with the upper part of your arms and your elbows glued to the sides of your chest.
Exaggerate the adhesion of your arms, if needed.
Have the turning of the body swing the arms back about halfway to the top of the backswing with stiff arms.
Swing the arms forward about halfway to the finish of the follow-through with stiff arms.
Break your left knee and right elbow on your halfswing back, break your right knee on your halfswing forward, and later the left elbow.
Continue swinging back and forth, breaking your knees and elbows accordingly.
As you continue this exercise, you will get the feeling that you are swinging with the hips.
The body swings the club, not the arms.
The exercise exaggerates a fundamental fact and feeling about the full golf swing: the action of the arms is motivated by the movements of the body, and the hands maintain a firm grip on the club consciously.
The training exercise is a half-swing back and forth.
The body swings the arms like a pendulum of a clock.
The elbows remain tightly glued to the sides.
Practice the complete backswing.
Visualize the proper plane and keep the arms traveling on that plane while swinging the club back.
Quite a few of my friends have told me that understanding the concept of the plane worked wonders for them.
The concept of the plane helped them break old bad habits and made correct movements feel natural.
The speaker never felt satisfied with their backswing until they based it on the concept of the plane.
Before 1938, the speaker struggled with an inconsistent backswing.
The speaker wondered if finding a set 'slot' for the club at the top of the backswing could solve the problem of inconsistency.
The speaker experimented with the golfer's plane and found swinging back along this plane helped maintain consistency in the backswing.
Swinging on this plane increased the speaker's confidence in the reliability of their backswing.
Practicing on this plane improved the speaker's overall swing, game, and attitude.
The speaker believed they could develop into a golfer of true championship caliber by following the plane technique.
The Second Part of the Swing is one of the greatest pleasures in golf.
Nothing truly compares to the sensation a golfer experiences at the instant he contacts the ball flush and correctly.
A distinctive 'sweet feeling' sweeps straight up the shaft from the clubhead and surges through the golfer's arms and whole frame.
The best golfer cannot hit the ball this well on every shot because golf is a game of misses.
Every seasoned, sensible golfer tries to build a swing that is so basically sound that his 'misses' are not bad golf shots—fairly well struck, accurate enough, and eminently serviceable.
The phase of the swing in which the player hits the ball will be discussed in this chapter.
The second section of the swing—from the start of the downswing to the finish of the follow-through—is the most crucial part.
Everything a player does from the moment he takes his club from the bag either pays off or doesn't in this section of the swing.
Each action in the swing is the direct result of preceding actions in the chain-action sequence.
Before tackling the downswing, it would be extremely profitable to review briefly the plane of the backswing.
Staying on the plane as he swings back is a golfer’s best insurance of being in a correct and powerful position at the critical juncture where the backswing ends and the downswing begins.
The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in 1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in other parts of Germany until the 18th century.
Scholar Richard Sermon writes that 'hares were frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition that hares laid eggs, since a hare’s scratch or form and a lapwing’s nest look very similar, and both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe. German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the Easter Bunny.'
The downswing is initiated by turning the hips to the left.
The shoulders release their power after the hips, followed by the arms, and then the hands.
The great speed developed in this chain action carries the golfer all the way around to the finish of his follow-through.
The golfer creates the angle of the plane of his backswing as he addresses the ball.
The plane of the backswing inclines along an imaginary line running from the ball to the top of the shoulders and on upward at the established angle of inclination.
If a golfer rotates his shoulders on this plane and swings his arms and club back on this plane without dropping them below or lifting them above, then at the top of his backswing his left arm will be extended at an angle identical with the plane.
The shoulders, arms, and hands will then be in a perfect position to carry out their movements on the downswing.
Thinking in terms of this plane has helped improve and stabilize swings of many golfers.
The visual suggestion of the plane induces a golfer to make correct backswing movements consistently.
The golfer folds the right elbow in, keeps the left arm fully extended but not rigid, completes a full shoulder turn, naturally cocks his hands, and maintains alignment throughout the backswing.
The various component parts are poised with the proper degree of muscular tension ready to be released on the downswing.
When studying a golfer's swing, the adherence to the backswing plane is checked.
Facing down the line of flight, the evaluator slants the forearm and hand along the angle of the plane to observe the golfer's backswing.
A golfer swings on a slightly different plane on the downswing compared to the backswing.
The plane for the downswing is less steeply inclined and oriented differently from the backswing plane.
During the downswing, when the golfer turns his hips back to the left, his body moves to the left and automatically lowers the right shoulder.
The golfer-reader was asked to imagine a scenario where his head is sticking out through a hole in an immense pane of glass resting on his shoulders, slanting up from the ball at address.
On the downswing, as the body shifts to the left and the right shoulder lowers, the pane of glass is repositioned, with its lateral axis no longer aligned with the line of flight but pointing slightly to the right of the target.
The pane of glass is also tilted so that the leading edge is raised off the ground.
When the golfer is on the correct downswing plane, he must hit from the inside out to achieve maximum strength and clubhead speed.
Hitting from the inside out eliminates the need for any compensation during the swing.
If a golfer starts the downswing incorrectly with the shoulders or hands instead of the hips, he cannot get onto the proper plane or hit from the inside out.
However, starting the downswing correctly by turning the hips ensures hitting from the inside out and sets up a good swing.
The golfer practically becomes the 'captive' of his own good swing when hitting from the inside out.
The backswing plane is seen from a top-view position.
At the top of the backswing, the left arm should incline at the exact angle of the plane.
The arm brushes against the glass pane.
The golfer gets on the downswing plane when he turns his hips to the left to initiate the downswing.
The downswing plane is inclined at a shallower angle than the plane of the backswing.
The lateral axis of the downswing plane points slightly to the right of the golfer’s target.
To check if a golfer remains on his plane during his backswing, I stand behind him and face down his line of flight.
I slant my forearm and hand along the line of what would be his correct plane.
When the golfer swings back, I can observe whether he stays on his plane.
When the golfer swings back, I can observe if he drops below his plane or lifts his arms above the plane.
While it is dynamically important for a golfer not to depart from his plane at any time during the second part of his swing.
A golfer should not depart from his plane at any time during the second part of his swing.
Being consciously attentive to it does not help him the way a consciousness of his backswing plane promotes a fine, functional backswing.
Conscious attentiveness to the swing plane does not provide the same benefits as awareness of the backswing plane for a golfer.
My advice would be to know that this downswing plane exists and have it at the back of your mind.
The advice is to acknowledge the existence of the downswing plane and keep it in mind.
To concentrate chiefly on making the one or two key movements which will really do something for you on the downswing.
The focus should primarily be on executing one or two key movements that will have a significant impact during the downswing.
The hips initiate the downswing.
The pivotal element in the chain action during the downswing is the hips.
Starting them first and moving them correctly — this one action practically makes the downswing.
Initiating the hips first and moving them correctly is crucial for a successful downswing.
It creates early speed.
This action generates early speed in the swing.
It transfers the weight from the right foot to the left foot.
Weight transfer from the right foot to the left foot is facilitated by this movement.
It takes the hips out of the way and gives your arms plenty of room to pass.
Moving the hips allows the arms to have sufficient space to move freely.
It funnels your force forward toward your objective.
This action directs the force towards the intended target.
It puts you in a strong hitting position where the big muscles in the back and the muscles in the shoulders, arms, and hands are properly delayed so that they can produce their maximum performance at the right time and place.
Positioning yourself correctly leads to a strong hitting position, allowing the major muscles to perform optimally.
To begin the downswing, turn your hips back to the left.
Initiate the downswing by rotating your hips towards the left.
There must be enough lateral motion forward to transfer the weight to the left foot.
Sufficient lateral movement forward is necessary to shift the weight onto the left foot.
The path the hips take on the downswing is not the exact same path they traveled as they were turned on the backswing.
The hip movement during the downswing differs slightly from the path during the backswing.
On the downswing, their 'arc' should be a trifle wider — both as regards the amount of lateral motion and the amount of eventual rotation around to the rear.
The arc of the hip movement during the downswing should be slightly wider in terms of lateral and rotational motion.
This turning of the hips is activated by several sets of muscles which work together.
Various muscle groups collaborate to initiate the hip rotation.
The contracted muscles of the left hip and the muscles along the inside of the left thigh start to spin the left hip around to the left.
The muscles in the left hip and left thigh interior begin the rotation of the left hip to the left.
At one and the same time, the muscles of the right hip and the muscles of the right thigh — both the inside and the powerful outside thigh muscles-start to move the right hip forward.
Simultaneously, the muscles in the right hip and both the inner and outer thigh muscles of the right leg start moving the right hip forward.
In order for them to do this work, these muscles must be stretched taut with tension that is just waiting for the golfer’s signal to be released.
Muscles must be tense and ready to be activated by the golfer to perform their function.
This tension is built up on the backswing by retarding the hips but rotating the shoulders fully around.
Tension is created during the backswing by slowing down the hip movement and fully rotating the shoulders.
If you permit the hips to turn too much on the backswing, this tension and torsion are lost and then there’s nothing to start them forward.
Excessive hip rotation during the backswing results in the loss of tension needed for the forward movement.
Imagine that, at address, one end of an elastic strip is fastened to a wall directly behind your left hip.
Visualize one end of an elastic strip attached to a wall behind your left hip during the address position.
THE OTHER END IS FASTENED TO YOUR LEFT HIPBONE.
The SHOULDERS TURN THE HIPS ON THE BACKSWING.
THE ELASTIC IS STRETCHED WITH INCREASED TENSION.
WHEN YOU START TURNING THE HIPS TO THE LEFT, THE ELASTIC WILL SNAP BACK TO THE LEFT WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED.
The greater the tension, the faster you can move them.
The faster the hips move, the better.
They can’t go too fast.
The movement of the hips inaugurates a whole chain of actions.
The left leg begins to break back to the left and the left knee turns a bit toward the target.
Starting the hips back also takes the pressure off the right leg.
As this happens, the weight flows to the left leg.
The right knee breaks in, definitely, toward the target.
It boosts the mounting velocity of the swing.
Each element adds its contribution to the multiplying speed generated by this cohesive movement of the body, legs, and arms toward the target.
This speed multiplies the golfer’s power 10 times over.
In the chain action of the swing, the shoulders and upper part of the body conduct this multiplying power into the arms.
The arms multiply it again and pass it on to the hands.
The hands multiply it in turn.
As a result, the clubhead is simply tearing through the air at an incredible speed as it drives through the ball.
Initiating the downswing with the hips is crucial for a good golf shot.
Many poor players start the downswing with their hands, affecting their shot negatively.
Poor players who start the downswing with their hands disrupt the rotation of the hips.
Starting the downswing with the hands leads to the upper body being out of the proper line.
When a golfer forces the club into the ball from the outside in, they tend to slice the shot.
If a golfer doesn't slice, they might pull the shot far to the left.
Starting the downswing with the hips can significantly improve a golfer's swing, shots, and score.
Some top golfers begin turning their hips left slightly before the club reaches the top of the backswing for better timing.
Initiating the downswing with the hips is emphasized over using the hands.
A novice or average golfer should avoid conscious hand action in their swing.
The correct swing relies on chain action, not on unnecessary hand movements.
The hands only become active after the arms have moved down to a position just above the hips on the downswing.
The movement of the hips carries the arms down during the downswing.
Moving the hips automatically brings the hands down to hip level due to their connection with the body's speed and power.
Only if they have carried out the fundamental movements will the correct parts of the body be correctly interpoised at this critical time in the swing to pick up this terrific load of energy and deliver it.
The correct parts of the body will be correctly interpoised at a critical time in the swing to pick up a load of energy and deliver it if they have carried out the fundamental movements.
The turning of the hips inaugurates the downswing.
The movement of the hips automatically lowers the arms and hands to a position just above hip level.
The movement of the hips lowers the arms and hands to a position just above hip level automatically.
When he has inaugurated his downswing by turning his hips, a golfer suddenly becomes aware of his tremendous stored-up power.
A golfer initiates the downswing by turning his hips.
After you have initiated the downswing with the hips, you want to think of only one thing: hitting the ball.
On a full drive, the speaker tries to hit the ball hard, sometimes as hard as he can.
On shots where the premium on distance is not high, the speaker tries to hit the ball as hard as the particular shot warrants.
The speaker doesn’t give as much as a passing thought to how the face of his club will contact the ball.
The face of the club contacting the ball is taken care of before, at address and during the waggle.
Consciously trying to control the face of the club at impact is folly.
You cannot time such a delicate and devilish thing.
The impact happens too fast, much too fast.
The correct hitting motion is one unbroken thrust from the beginning of the downswing to the end of the follow-through.
The speaker thinks of only two things: starting the hips back and then hitting just as hard as he can with the upper part of his body, his arms and hands, in that order.
When the speaker explains the one-piece hit-through action, he generally experiences two main types of reactions from the members of a clinic audience.
The first type of reaction is a kind of polite skepticism.
The second type of reaction is sort of a misguided cynicism.
Bob Richards tells a certain explanation about pole-vaulting.
Bob Richards is mentioned in comparison to Hogan.
The average golfer has the physical ability to use the same methods as top golfers.
The average golfer's issue is more about not knowing what to do than about lacking ability.
A player reaches the phase of the downswing when his hands are at the level of his hips.
This phase is termed the start of the impact segment of the swing.
If the player has executed the swing correctly until that point, he instinctively hits through the ball and follows through.
Having a clear understanding of the arm and hand movements during this part of the swing is beneficial.
Practicing these movements intelligently will improve the golfer's skill.
The right arm and hand's motion in the impact area is likened to how an infielder throws a ball to first base after fielding a ground ball.
Right arm swings forward.
The right elbow is very close to the right hip.
The right elbow 'leads' the arm.
The right elbow is the part of the arm nearest the target.
The left arm and hand lead the right arm and hand.
Hit through with the left as hard as with the right.
Study the correct motion of the right arm and hand in the impact area.
The motion is quite similar to the one an infielder makes when he throws half underhand, half sidearm to first after scooping up a ground ball.
As the player swings his arm forward, his right elbow is very close to his right hip.
The elbow 'leads' the arm.
The forearm and hand catch up with the elbow.
The player’s arm is extended relatively straight when he releases the ball.
As the player follows through, the wrist and hand gradually turn over.
The player's palm faces the ground at the finish of the follow-through.
On a full shot, hit the ball as hard as you can with your right hand.
HIT THE BALL AS HARD AS YOU CAN WITH BOTH HANDS.
The left is a power hand.
If you hit hard with only the right and let the left go to sleep, you will lose valuable power and run into errors that result when the right hand overpowers the left.
HIT AS HARD WITH THE LEFT AS WITH THE RIGHT.
Study the correct integrated motion the two arms and hands make as they approach the ball and hit through it.
Consider the feeling as the motion is happening.
If there is any motion in sports which it resembles, it is the old two-handed basketball pass from the right side of the body.
As the player enters the impact area and the hands start to pass the right hip.
It is almost as if his hands were holding a ball as they move toward the target.
His hands are positioned just the way they are on the shaft.
The ball is about the size of the two hands.
The ball is heavy, similar to a small-sized medicine ball.
It takes muscle to throw the ball hard.
A fairly large target stands straight ahead of the player, maybe four or five yards down his line of flight.
The center of the target is about the same height from the ground as the player’s belt buckle.
As the player shifts weight from his right foot to his left to put all his power into the throw, he flings the ball at the target as hard as he can.
The player whips the ball with both arms and both hands to throw it harder and more accurately.
The player wants the ball to travel on a line and smash into the center of the target emphatically to knock the bull’s-eye off it.
The forcefulness of this effort carries the player all the way around in his follow-through.
The joint two-hand action keeps the left hand driving all the time.
During the climactic part of the swing, the left wrist and the back of the left hand begin to supinate very slightly.
They continue to supinate throughout the rest of the swing.
The sequence drawings describe the gradual supination more clearly than words can.
There is one position of great importance at the actual moment of impact.
At impact, the back of the left hand faces toward the target.
The wrist bone is definitely raised and points to the target.
At the moment the ball is contacted, the wrist bone is out in front, nearer to the target than any part of the hand.
When the left wrist is in this position, the left hand will not check or interrupt the speed of the clubhead.
There is no danger that the right hand will overpower the left and twist the club over.
Every good golfer has his left wrist in the supinating position at impact.
Every poor golfer does the exact reverse, starting to pronate the left wrist as the club comes into the ball.
When a golfer’s left wrist begins to pronate just before impact, it changes the golfer's arc.
Pronating the left wrist shortens the arc drastically and makes the pitch of the upswing too steep and constricted.
Pronating the left wrist slows down the speed of the golfer's hands instead of increasing it at the right moment.
Pronating the left wrist causes the golfer to expend all speed before hitting the ball.
Letting the left wrist and hand pronate leads to catching the ball too low on the blade or skulling it.
Pronating can result in hitting the back of the ball or getting a big scoop slice if the face of the club is open.
Pronating can cause pulling and hooks if the face of the club is closed, leading the ball off its intended line.
Pronating prevents the golfer from experiencing the 'sweet feeling.'
The downswing arc of a golfer who pronates closely follows the pattern of the backswing arc, which is not ideal.
Supinating sets up desirable actions for the player.
Supinating helps the player develop a properly wide forward arc.
Supinating positions the player with well-extended arms at impact and after impact as they swing out toward the objective.
A wider arc allows more room for building up clubhead speed, which is crucial for distance.
The left wrist begins to supinate at impact.
The left wristbone is raised.
The raised wristbone points to the target.
By pronating his left wrist just before impact, a golfer expends his clubhead speed before he strikes the ball.
A golfer pronates his left wrist just before impact.
The golfer expends his clubhead speed before striking the ball.
Pronation restricts the arc of his swing.
Pronation opens the golfer to making numerous other errors.
Supination builds distance and accuracy in other ways.
Supination helps you to strike the ball absolutely clean.
Supination builds distance and accuracy in other ways by helping you strike the ball absolutely clean.
Every good golfer supinates his left wrist.
Supinating the left wrist is a 'must' in golf.
Jimmy Demaret emphasizes the supination action the most among all players.
Jimmy Demaret lashing the ball with the back of his left hand is a key factor in his success and longevity as a player.
Supinating the left wrist enables maximum grip and backspin on the ball.
Supination helps in hitting a correct stroke in golf.
Supination enables hitting a low-flying wedge shot that bites immediately upon landing and spins close to the landing spot.
When playing shots near the green, the hands should function similarly to a full swing.
The club face supplies the loft; supination helps in providing a correct stroke in golf.
A golfer should aim for a coordinated golf swing rather than a downward chop or an upward scoop.
Correct positions in the impact area and follow-through are crucial in golf.
A good golfer naturally moves into correct positions by starting the downswing with hip turn and hitting through to the finish in one unified motion.
Forcing oneself into correct positions is not recommended; they should naturally occur if the fundamentals are executed properly.
Touching on these points can clarify popular misconceptions about the golf swing.
Implant more firmly correct positive ideas that can be used as guides and checkpoints during practice and play.
Most golfers have the mistaken idea that at the moment of impact, both arms should be straightened out their full length.
At impact, the right arm is still bent slightly.
On the downswing, the right arm gradually straightens out as it comes into the ball.
The right arm straightens out completely when the clubhead is two feet or so past the ball.
At the point when the clubhead is two feet or so past the ball, the left arm is also straight, the only time in the swing that both arms are fully extended.
Led by the supinating left wrist, the left arm begins to fold in at the elbow after both arms are fully extended.
The right arm remains straight through to the finish of the swing.
At the finish of the swing, the left elbow points directly to the ground, and the top of the player’s right shoulder hits up against his chin.
The chin hits the shoulder about an inch from the end of the shoulder.
The correct order of movement on the downswing is hips, shoulders, arms, and hands.
As each component part enters the swing, it adds its contribution to the multiplying speed generated by this cohesive chain-action movement to the left.
At the point just beyond impact where both arms are straight and extended, the clubhead reaches its maximum speed, not at impact.
This speed carries the golfer around in a big high finish.
At the completion of the swing, the player’s belt buckle should point definitely to the left of his target, not directly at it.
If the player has completed the swing with his hips, the hipbones should be squared to the front.
The hips lead the shoulders in the golf swing.
The shoulders finally catch up with the hips at the end of the swing.
A great many golfers think that classical style prescribes that, at impact and throughout the follow-through, the left leg should be as straight as a stick.
If you keep your left leg straight, you prohibit your hips from making their full turn and restrict the whole free flow of your body to the left.
When your weight doesn’t get sufficiently transferred to the left, your arc is cramped, and your body, arms and hands cannot release the full power they’re capable of pouring into the shot.
On a good swing, when the player’s hands are approaching hip level on the downswing, his hips have already reached that point in their turn when they have begun to open — to face down the fairway.
The belt buckle, when the hands are hip high, is about in line with the ball.
The two legs respond to the hip turn on the downswing.
The left leg breaks resiliently to the left, and as the bulk of the weight rides forward to the left side of the left foot, the leg bows out toward the target.
The right leg breaks in at the knee as the hip turn starts.
When you’re practicing this lesson, I suggest you spend some time reviewing the backswing plane and devote perhaps a half hour daily to the hip turn and the hit-through movements.
Many golfers are afraid of swinging too hard.
They figure that unless they restrain their power, they’ll magnify their errors.
If you are working with muscles that are fully extended on swing after swing, there has to be more uniformity than if your muscles are flexed with varying degrees of tension and so “give” differently on one swing and another.
I feel, and I have proved to myself, that I can hit a ball straighter if I hit it hard and full.
When he is playing a long and testing course, a golfer who has a sound swing wouldn’t mind at all having the physique of a giant.
The more power he had at his command, the better he’d feel about it.
He’d know how to use it.
He’d be so long he’d be shooting back at the greens!
The material presented in this book amounts to a sifting of the knowledge the author picked up during his 25 years as a professional golfer.
The author is hopeful that these lessons will accomplish two things.
The lessons will greatly increase the average player’s enjoyment of the game by enabling them to become a real golfer with a sound, powerful, repeating swing.
The lessons will do this for any player who gains a clear understanding of the fundamental movements discussed in the first four lessons and who continues to practice and familiarize themselves with these fundamentals throughout the golf season.
In the final chapter, the author will be putting the whole swing together as they review the modern fundamentals of golf.
The author also hopes that these lessons will serve as a body of knowledge that will lead to further advances in the understanding of the golf swing.
Every year, there are new discoveries and advancements in golf, leading to greater knowledge.
Golf is compared to medicine and other fields of science in terms of continuous learning and advancement.
In another 15 years, it is expected that there will be many new discoveries in golf based on present-day progress.
A golfer has 15 or 20 really productive years to realize their full potential and experiment with different techniques.
Due to limitations in time and resources, a golfer can only find out so much within those productive years.
If the author had known in 1931 what he learned by 1957, he could have possibly made more advanced contributions during his best productive years.
Younger golfers will have the privilege of starting their experimentation at a more advanced point than the author did.
I find it is helpful if I jot down after practicing exactly what I have been working on.
I find jotting down after practicing helps me track my progress.
I was thinking the other day, 'What a long time I have been learning about golf!'
I realized that I have been learning about golf for a long time.
I must have been about 13 when I started to work on my game conscientiously.
I started working on my golf game conscientiously when I was around 13 years old.
I was caddying at the Glen Garden club in Fort Worth.
I caddied at the Glen Garden club in Fort Worth.
I took a member named Ed Stewart as my model.
I chose Ed Stewart, a very fine amateur golfer, as my role model.
Stewart was a workingman who couldn’t afford to play too often.
Ed Stewart, a workingman, couldn’t afford to play golf frequently.
None of the other boys wanted to become his regular caddy.
None of the other boys were interested in being his regular caddy.
That suited me fine.
That situation worked well for me.
I caddied for him whenever he played and studied his swing and his shotmaking technique closely.
I observed Ed Stewart's swing and shotmaking technique closely while caddying for him.
I'd go and compare my swing with his.
I compared my swing to his.
I tried to improve my swing by copying certain of Stewart’s movements that were obviously correct and desirable.
I attempted to enhance my swing by emulating specific movements of Stewart's that were correct and effective.
The first really important change I effected was the action of my left knee.
The first significant change I made was adjusting the action of my left knee.
Mine used to shoot straight out when I took the club back.
My left knee used to extend straight out when I swung the club back.
Stewart’s knee broke in nicely to the right.
I noticed Stewart’s knee breaking in nicely to the right.
I practiced correcting my knee action on the lawn at home.
I practiced correcting my knee action on the lawn at home until there was no lawn left.
Sometimes I chipped from one lawn to the next on my way to the store.
Sometimes I set the lawn two or three hedges away as my “green” on my way to the store.
Sometimes I hit to the farthest “green” with a full nine-iron shot on my way to the store.
I was checking my left knee action or whatever phase of my swing I was working on all the time on my way to the store.
My practice probably didn't improve the looks of the neighborhood.
My practice was awfully good for my game.
I came to understand the value of the waggle comparatively early.
I learned from observing Johnny Revolta that he modified his waggle to suit each shot around the greens.
Johnny Revolta geared himself for the different demands of each shot around the greens by modifying his waggle to suit that particular shot.
Johnny Revolta used sharp, staccato, jabby strokes for shots that needed to produce maximum bite.
I learned from talking with Johnny Revolta about modifying the waggle for different shots.
I learned from Johnny Revolta the importance of adapting the waggle for different shots.
I learned from Johnny Revolta the importance of adapting the waggle for both short and full shots.
I began to adapt Johnny Revolta’s method for my short shots and full shots immediately.
I got the correct hip-turn action clear in my mind in the middle 1930s.
I studied newsreel movies of the best golfers in action to understand the correct hip-turn action.
I grasped the concept of the plane in 1938.
I had been thinking sporadically about the plane before 1938.
I had been examining the plane on which the batter swings in baseball.
I made some tentative suppositions about the plane before grasping its concept in 1938.
The golfer’s plane was a significant concern for the speaker.
The speaker began a serious investigation of the plane due to worries about the unreliability of their backswing.
The speaker studied their backswing plane in the full-length mirror in their hotel room during the winter circuit.
The speaker aimed to memorize their backswing plane to instinctively swing back the same way every time.
Before 1946, the speaker did not feel genuinely confident about their game.
The speaker's friends on the tour reassured them about their grooved swing and reason to have confidence in it.
In 1946, the speaker's attitude towards their game changed, feeling they could count on playing fairly well each time they went out.
The speaker realized that focusing on the fundamental movements of the golf swing was more important than trying to do many difficult things perfectly.
The speaker noticed a new and stable consistency in their shot making as they began to feel confident in playing creditable golf even when not at their best.
The basis for the speaker's progress in golf was their genuine conviction about what is required to play good golf.
Executing properly involves a relatively small number of true fundamental movements.
Golfer performs key fundamental actions to move correctly from one position to another.
Arriving at the correct position at the finish of the swing does not involve specific new actions in the last stages.
The follow-through is the result of the proper chain-action movement and clubhead speed.
The golfer must come into the ball and hit through it correctly to follow through correctly.
Golfer must do major things to be correctly poised and positioned as he hits through the ball.
Initiating the downswing involves turning the hips to the left.
Hitting through to the finish of the swing requires hitting with the hips, shoulders, arms, and hands in that order.
Starting to supinate the left wrist just before impact is essential.
Concentrating on these movements is necessary if the golfer is in the correct position at the top of the backswing.
The correct position at the top of the backswing is achieved by the golfer.
He will be essentially correct when he arrives at the top of his backswing if he waggles properly.
He will be essentially correct when he arrives at the top of his backswing if he starts back with his hands, arms, and shoulders and lets his shoulders turn his hips.
He will be essentially correct when he arrives at the top of his backswing if he stays on his plane throughout his backswing.
These are all the movements he has to work on during his backswing.
He is correctly positioned and poised at address.
The correct position at address consists of a correct stance and posture.
The correct position at address consists of a correct grip.
The whole swing starts with the grip and builds from there.
Each correct movement is linked with and sets up the next ensuing movement.
The whole swing is chain action.
When a certain phase of his swing is not functioning properly, he should refresh his knowledge of that particular phase.
He should refresh his knowledge of that particular phase by rereading the pertinent pages in the earlier chapters.
He should work things out on the practice tee.
Whether he is practicing or playing, he should school himself to think in terms of the cause and not the result.
If a golfer picks his head up and mis-hits his shot badly, his partner will usually tell him, 'You didn’t keep your head down,' as if this were the true cause of his poor shot.
The true cause was some faulty movement in the golfer’s swing that made him pull his head up.
For example, if the golfer starts down from the top with his shoulders or his hands and not with his hips, he can’t possibly hold.
His head is where it should be.
If you are swinging correctly, you can’t look at anything but the ball.
Let us briefly review some of the significant positions and movements that you would do well to practice and check as you work to build a correct, powerful, repeating swing.
The Grip Left Hand Place the club so that the shaft is pressed up under the muscular pad of the heel.
The shaft is pressed up under the muscular pad of the heel.
The muscular pad of the heel is where the shaft is pressed up.
The shaft also lies across the top joint of the forefinger.
The main pressure points are the last three fingers and the heel pad.
The V should point to the right eye.
Right Hand A finger grip.
The shaft should lie across the top joint of the fingers, definitely below the palm.
The two middle fingers apply most of the pressure.
Practice with the thumb off the shaft.
Practice with the forefinger off the shaft.
The V points directly to the chin.
Completed Grip Both hands should work together as one unit.
The little finger of the right hand locks into the groove between the forefinger and big finger of the left hand.
The left thumb should fit snuggly into the cup of the right palm.
A diagram shows the correct location of calluses.
Stance is being discussed.
Posture is being discussed.
There is one correct basic stance: the right foot is square to the line.
The left foot is pointed out a quarter turn.
On a five-iron, the feet should be set apart the width of the shoulders.
The stance widens for the longer clubs.
The stance narrows for shorter clubs.
It is extremely important to keep the elbows and the arms as close together as possible.
The knees point in when you bend the knees.
The upper trunk remains erect when you bend the knees.
Right elbow should point directly to the right hip.
Left elbow should point directly to the left hip.
Correct stance will govern the proper amount of hip turn.
Stance is crucial for determining the proper amount of hip turn.
The first part of the swing is called The Plane.
The backswing plane inclines upward from the ball through the shoulders.
Arms should be moving parallel with the plane as they approach hip level on the backswing.
Arms should remain parallel with the plane throughout the backswing.
The Waggle is another part of the swing.
When the player waggles the club back, the right elbow should hit the front part of the right hip.
The lower part of his left arm rotates on the back waggle.
The golfer actually gets on backswing plane.
The hands start the club back.
The arms start the club back.
The shoulders start the club back almost simultaneously.
The shoulders turn as the shoulders start to turn the hips.
Correct tension is created in the muscles between the shoulders and hips.
The correct tension is created by retarding hip turn.
The Second Part of the Swing Just before impact, left wrist begins to supinate.
The left wristbone is raised and faces directly toward the target.
The turning of the hips back to the left initiates the downswing.
The movement of the hips automatically lowers the arms and the hands to a position just above the level of the hips.
In the chain action of the downswing, the hips are the pivotal element.
The turning of the hips to the left releases the body, legs, and arms in a cohesive movement to the left.
Each component adds its contribution to the ever-increasing speed and power of the swing.
In this chain action, the shoulders and the upper part of the body conduct the multiplying power into the arms.
The arms multiply it again and pass it on to the hands.
The hands multiply it in turn.
The clubhead is tearing through the air at an incredible speed as the golfer hits through the ball.
The golf swing presented in these lessons is the essential golf swing, stripped down to its authentic fundamentals.
The golfer needs these fundamentals to develop a correct, powerful swing that will repeat.
If a man or woman of average ability learns to execute these fundamental movements, there is no movement in this swing.
Coordination cannot perform.
He will continue to become a more and more skillful player.
The player who thinks he can construct a swing on hand action is doomed to be erratic.
The golfer whose swing is founded on chain action cannot help but have timing.
The chain action itself is the timing.
The golfer has to learn only one swing.
The golfer uses the same fundamental swing for every shot he plays.
On all standard shots, the ball should be spotted in the same position relative to the left foot.
The relative position of the left foot and the ball remains constant.
When you narrow the width of the stance to accommodate the shorter shafts of the irons, you do this by moving the right foot progressively closer to the left foot and toward the ball.
You make no conscious variation in the way you perform your swing when playing different clubs.
Your swing will change slightly as the length of the shaft of the club changes.
The shorter the shaft, the closer the player must stand to the ball.
The player's plane becomes more upright when standing closer to the ball with a shorter shaft.
The length of the arc is naturally shortened when the player stands closer to the ball with a shorter shaft.
When you shorten your arc, you have less time on your swing to get your left hip out of the way.
You make a mild modification when playing the clubs from the six-iron down to the wedge: get the left hip out of the way before you begin to play your stroke.
You do this by setting your right foot a bit nearer the ball at address.
Setting the right foot nearer the ball at address has the effect of drawing the left foot back from the direct line and turning the left hip a bit to the left.
When you play the clubs from the six-iron down with your body in this position, you still feel like you’re taking a full swing.
Actually, you’re not taking a full swing.
You have placed a further restriction on the length.
Your arc will sacrifice some distance as a result.
The club cannot travel so fast on a shorter arc.
You will lose distance but make up for it in direction.
Accuracy is the primary consideration when playing the short irons.
The golfer-reader has applied himself with some diligence to these lessons.
The golfer-reader has spent at least a week on each lesson.
The golfer-reader should already be well on his way to developing a correct, repeating swing.
You cannot expect to acquire real control of the correct movements in a month’s time.
You must continue to work on these fundamentals throughout the golf season.
You must work on the fundamentals both on the course and on the practice tee.
Through steady familiarization, you will gradually execute the movements of the swing more easily and efficiently.
An average golfer who has applied himself intelligently should be coming close to breaking 80 or actually break 80 within six months.
The average golfer will continue to improve.
The familiarization gained over just one season of abiding by and practicing the fundamentals will make the correct movements second nature for the golfer.
He can trust his swing to muscle memory.
He can turn more attention to managing his golf.
He can think out the proper strategy for playing each hole.
He can decide which of the alternate routes to the pin is the wise one under the immediate conditions.
He can play the right kind of shot to suit the terrain and the elements.
He can meet the ever-fresh challenge.
